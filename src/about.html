                    I am from East West University. My university life was charming and productive. In this period I have learned all the basics of programming and built up my problem-solving skill. Some courses were very interesting and helped me to learn how to think like a programmer. My thesis was on data science. I and my groupmate proposed a hybrid algorithm in which performance is very much better than the conventional algorithms for data clustering.
